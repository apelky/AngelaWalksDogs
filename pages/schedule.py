schedule.py last edited on ?.

This acts as a page of my web app that prompts the user to schedule a service and adds it to my calendar.
Please note that this is a prototype, and some of the questions prompted such as address and key code could be compromisable.
Upon release of this app please ensure that all security measures have been met. Furthermore, this schedule does not include the need
for driving time between bookings. It would also be nice if I could find a way to make Google Calendar look nicer. Another possible addition
is to make sure that the person pays by deleting the event if payment is not processed using the Stripe API. This program calls 
upon the helper progam Authenticator.py to build the Google Calendar and insert an event into it.

schedule.py uses Python 3.10
