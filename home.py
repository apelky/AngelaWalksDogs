and through! I am a responsible student at the University of Oregon 
looking to spend time with dogs. I have a wonderful pup of my own 
named Lacy, and I have a lot of experience dog walking and pet sitting. 
Also, Iâ€™m a vegetarian if that helps give insight to how much I love 
animals! I canâ€™t wait to meet your amazing dog. I know how dear they are
to your heart, so I will be sure to take 
amazing care of them :)""")
